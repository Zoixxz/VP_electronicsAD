In this repository the code and possibly some measured data for the electronics A+D experiment can be found.
- an arduino thermometer using the grove temperature sensor and the grove RGB lcd display to show the temperature.
- an second thermometer using a thermistor and a four pin fan for temperature regulation
- a PID controlled cooling/heating loop built ontop of the thermistor circuit
